ASP.NET Core based on the new .NET 5 runtime, is Microsoft’s modern, cross-platform framework for building enterprise ready web applications. In this course, you will learn everything you need to know about building a RESTful API using .NET Core 5, from understanding the folder structure and files, to building and deploying a complete web REST API.

## Why Learn ASP.NET Core / .NET 5

Microsoft .NET is the platform that drives the business technology of many of the top corporations in the United States and many other countries. It is the predominant technology used to drive enterprise-scale business technology. Companies have chosen .NET because for its proven scalability, reliability, and support. Not many technologies have achieved this level of stability, maturity and speed. Creating a flexible yet stable technology is quite a feat, and that’s exactly what ASP.NET Core developers have achieved.

The .NET language of choice to learn is C#, as it is among the most widely used languages today. It’s a general purpose programming language that can handle almost any problem, from desktop to mobile to dynamic web applications. As such, there is a high demand across the world for .NET developers in a variety of industries, so that means that more jobs are available for candidates with a foundation built upon .NET technologies.

## Why Learn to Build An API

The acronym API means Application Programming Interface. The ability to design and maintain an API is an important toolset for the modern web developer. It allows you to extend the accessibility of your software to external applications and other developers, leading to a more global software solution.

REST APIs have become a standard in the industry because of their ability to serve essential functionality from any kind of backend, to any kind of frontend while catering to thousands of clients simultaneously. There is no time like now to skill up and start adding ASP.NET Core Web API to your skillset.
